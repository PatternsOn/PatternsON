       <div id="biography">
         <p><SPAN STYLE="color: hotpink; font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold">Born</span> in 1984 and based in Gothenburg. John has been DJing,
           as well as producing tracks, since the late 90s, with early
           musical influences spanning across a wide range of genres,
           from Swedish techno to IDM, Cologne acid craziness and the
           sound of Chicago house tracks.</p>

          <p>The musical output of his DJ-sets usually varies between melodic
          and soulful techno, tech house, house or acid depending on the
          time and location. On rare occassions during the summer you might
          also find him spinning dub techno or ambient in some haunting Swedish
          forest in the middle of nowhere.</p>

          <p>His goal, he explains, is to give the crowd a fresh and different
          experience each time, but always taking them on that 2-8 hour+ mental
          journey thru sound and dance.</p>

          <p>John has performed on several locations all around Sweden, but also
          done appreciated gigs in other European countries at clubs like Tresor and
          Culture Box, and his music has been featured in sets by DJs such as Sven VÃ¤th,
          Adam Beyer, Joris Voorn, Dense & Pika, Cari Lekebusch, Alan Fitzpatrick, Karotte,
          Gregor Tresher, The Hacker and many more.</p>
