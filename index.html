             <p>Born in 1984 and based in Gothenburg. John has been DJing,
               as well as producing tracks, since the late 90s, with early
               musical influences spanning across a wide range of genres,
               from Swedish techno to IDM, Cologne acid craziness and the
               sound of Chicago house tracks.</p>

              <p>The musical output of his DJ-sets usually varies between melodic
              and soulful techno, tech house, house or acid depending on the
              time and location. On rare occassions during the summer you might
              also find him spinning dub techno or ambient in some haunting Swedish
              forest in the middle of nowhere.</p>

              <p>His goal, he explains, is to give the crowd a fresh and different
              experience each time, but always taking them on that 2-8 hour+ mental
              journey thru sound and dance.</p>

              <p>John has performed on several locations all around Sweden, but also
              done appreciated gigs in other European countries at clubs like Tresor and
              Culture Box, and his music has been featured in sets by DJs such as Sven VÃ¤th,
              Adam Beyer, Joris Voorn, Dense & Pika, Cari Lekebusch, Alan Fitzpatrick, Karotte,
              Gregor Tresher, The Hacker and many more.</p>
